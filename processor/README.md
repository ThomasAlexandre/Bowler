SBT Sample Processor
====================

This is a SBT processor in progress and not yet entirely functional. 
It uses and is heavily based on the great work of Lifty and Lifty-Engine: https://github.com/Lifty/Lifty-engine/

To get started simple clone the repository: 
-------------------------------------------

Once SBT has started run the following commands in the SBT console

<pre><code>publish-local
*someName is org.bowlerframework sample_sbt_processor 1.0
</code></pre>

Now you can run the processor as you would any other command

<pre><code>someName create project-name</code></pre>
