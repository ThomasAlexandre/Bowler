DEFECTS
- Fixed issue with Jade- and Scaml templates not being able to compile
- Fixed issue with JSON not being rendered arbitrarily for case classes with multiple constructors (lift-json issue, workaround for now, will remove workaround on released lift-json fix)
- Fixed not able to update numberformatting in Scalate templates (fixed by Scalate 1.4.1)
- JsonViewRenderer now throws Exceptions properly so validation errors etc can be properly rendered by container level custom ErrorHandler

FEATURES
- Upgrade to Scalate 1.4.1
- Upgrade to Squeryl 0.9.4.RC5 for Squeryl integration
